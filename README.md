This project is a sophisticated, AI-powered system designed to operate with minimal human input. It autonomously researches topics using various news APIs, processes the data to generate summaries and keywords, and stores the results in a searchable knowledge base.

---

##  Features

-   **ü§ñ Autonomous Research**: Fetches and processes information from multiple news sources with a resilient fallback system.
-   **üìù AI-Powered Summarization**: Utilizes Hugging Face models to generate concise, abstractive summaries for articles.
-   **üîë Automatic Topic Extraction**: Employs Natural Language Processing to identify and tag key topics and entities.
-   **üß† Vector Knowledge Base**: Stores article information in a Qdrant vector database for semantic "search by meaning" functionality.
-   **üìä Analytics Dashboard**: Provides high-level statistics on research tasks and stored documents.
-   **üñ•Ô∏è Modern Tech Stack**: Built with a robust FastAPI backend and a responsive Next.js frontend.

---

##  Built With

The project is built with a modern, scalable tech stack.

-   **Frontend**: Next.js, React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS
-   **Backend**: Python, FastAPI
-   **Database**: PostgreSQL & Qdrant (via Docker)
-   **AI/ML**: Hugging Face, Sentence-Transformers, TextBlob

##  Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed on your system:
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [Python 3.10+](https://www.python.org/)
* [Node.js (LTS)](https://nodejs.org/)
* [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/akasuman/autonomous-ai-worker.git
    cd Cothon_Project_Final
    ```

2.  **Launch Databases with Docker**
    Start Docker Desktop, then run the following command from the project's root folder to start the PostgreSQL and Qdrant containers.
    ```sh
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

3.  **Backend Setup**
    This involves setting up API keys and installing Python dependencies.

    * Navigate to the backend directory:
        ```sh
        cd backend
        ```
    * Create a `.env` file for your secret keys. You will need to get keys from [GNews](https://gnews.io/), [NewsData.io](https://newsdata.io/), and [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/).
        * **On Windows (PowerShell):**
            ```powershell
            copy .env.example .env
            ```
        * **On macOS/Linux:**
            ```sh
            cp .env.example .env
            ```
    * Open the new `.env` file and add your keys:
        ```env
        GNEWS_API_KEY="your_gnews_key_here"
        NEWSDATA_API_KEY="your_newsdata_key_here"
        HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN="your_huggingface_token_here"
        ```
    * Create and activate a Python virtual environment:
        * **On Windows (PowerShell):**
            ```powershell
            python -m venv venv
            .\venv\Scripts\activate
            ```
        * **On macOS/Linux:**
            ```sh
            python3 -m venv venv
            source venv/bin/activate
            ```
    * Install Python dependencies:
        ```sh
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```

4.  **Frontend Setup**
    * Navigate to the frontend directory from the root folder:
        ```sh
        cd frontend
        ```
    * Install the Node.js dependencies:
        ```sh
        npm install
        ```

##  Running the Application

You will need two separate terminals to run the backend and frontend servers simultaneously.

### Terminal 1: Run the Backend

```sh
# Navigate to the backend directory (if not already there)
cd backend

# Activate the virtual environment if it's not already active
# On Windows:
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
# source venv/bin/activate

# Start the FastAPI server
uvicorn app.main:app --reload

### Terminal 2: Run the Frontend
Bash

# Navigate to the frontend directory (from the root folder)
cd frontend

# Start the Next.js development server
npm run dev
 The frontend should now be running at http://localhost:3000.

 Roadmap
[ ] Implement user authentication and role-based access.

[ ] Add voice-based queries for initiating research tasks.

[ ] Integrate additional data sources (e.g., scientific papers, social media).

[ ] Develop a more advanced analytics and visualization dashboard.
